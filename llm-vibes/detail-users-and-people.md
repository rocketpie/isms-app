lets review the isms.sql 
It looks like the audit_log is confusing users and people. 
people are a managed information asset, like process, application, system etc. 
they might not know that this app even exists. 
they can be members of a team, and they, or a team, can be owners of other assets, like process etc. 

users of this app (viewers, editors, approvers) are not the same thing. 
users edit these assets (add a new process, and set the owner) 
users will need to log in to this app and interact with it. 
auditing refers to users.
